BIX: nkonz, CI$: 76046,223

Usage: SWAPDCP [-l n] [-s k1 k2 [...]] [-h] filename.DCP
   -l n         sets listing level to n ( 0-3 )
                0: no listing output
                1: basic info, status output (default)
                2: level 1 plus table headers
                3: level 2 plus key entries
   -s k1 k2     swaps keys with scan codes k1 and k2
                (multiple -s arguments are processed in order)
   -h           prints extended help to standard output and quits
                (run as "SWAPDCP -h | more" or "SWAPDCP -h >file")

For instance, to swap the control and caps-lock keys on your keyboard,
you might use (assuming OS/2 is on your drive C:):

    COPY C:\OS2\KEYBOARD.DCP C:\OS2\MYKBD.DCP
    SWAPDCP -s 29 58 C:\OS2\MYKBD.DCP

This swaps the key definitions in-place.

You could then change the line in your CONFIG.SYS which goes something like:
    DEVINFO=KBD,US,C:\OS2\KEYBOARD.DCP
to:
    DEVINFO=KBD,US,C:\OS2\MYKBD.DCP

The next time you start up, your keys will be changed.

To understand the output of the program, you should read the Physical Device
Driver manual in the section "Keyboard IOCtls" about function 0x50 - Set
Code Page.

To get the ID of the scan codes, you could use a PC tech ref manual,
or run the program with the "-l 3" option to produce a full key listing.

I figured out the layout of the .DCP file myself.
